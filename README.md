# InvestmentTracker

This is an Android application which can help you keep track of money going out of your account. It's not an budget management tool, we're not here to manage your day to day spending. This application is here to track all the investment you do. So for example you have invested money in stocks, etfs, bonds, retirement fund, high yield savings account, Fixed deposits, gold bar in your locker or just some money in your savings account. This app will allow you to list all this investments and allow you to categorize it into different categories of investment. And best part is it will calculate the amount invested in each category and show you a graph showing percentage of investment done in all various categories. So consider this application as your one step to see all the money that you invest in all the places.


Ofcourse you can do it using excel as well. But we're not competing with excel. We're here just to give you easy way to check your finances. If you prefer to use excel, use that. But make sure your excel file is password protected and with you at all times. Because this application has fingerprint authentication and is installed on your phone on all times. So you just need to take out your phone and check your investments. 


This application uses no internet connection. So we won't track the prices of your investment along the years. There are plenty of applications that do that already. We're here to track money going out of your checking account into different type of investment. Consider it an easy way to check how much money you've invested over the years.

This application don't use internet connection, so be sure that data you insert in this application is not shared with anyone. It's just for you to see.

Version 0.4 


- This release has working implementation for fingerprint scanner. You just need to use your device credentials to log in. So for example if you want to use pin instead of fingerprint, you need to click 'USE PIN' button. And pin would be the pin you use to unlock your device. I don't want you to remember yet another pin for another app. So use the same old device pin. 

- After login in the application, press + sign to add new investment. If your investment is in INR then select rupee sign on the top, if it's in USD then select $ sign. You need to fill in all the mandatory details on that Add investment page.

- After you're done adding details press ADD button on the bottom, if you can't see that button please scroll down a little.

- You can edit the investment from homepage, home page would be the page where you see the graph. You need to long click on the investment and that will get you to edit page. If you find it tough to find, please let me know so I can make it easier for user to find this edit option.

- We don't have DELETE investment feature implemented yet. So for now if you make an investment and want to delete it, please consider editing it into different investment altogether.
