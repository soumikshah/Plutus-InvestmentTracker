# InvestmentTracker

This is an Android application which can help you keep track of money going out of your account. It's not an budget management tool, we're not here to manage your day to day spending. This application is here to track all the investment you make. So for example you have invested money in stocks, etfs, bonds, retirement fund, high yield savings account, Fixed deposits, gold bar in your locker or just some money in your savings account. This app will allow you to list all this investments and allow you to categorize it into different categories/sector of investment. It will also list you through which application/method you invested your money (For example you use couple of brokers to manage your stock portfolio, this application will allow you to list through which website/app had you invested your money. So when you open this app, it should be easier for you to notice which app to check for particular investment)  And best part is it will calculate the amount invested in each category and show you a graph showing percentage of investment done in all various categories. So consider this application as your one step way to see all the money that you invest in all the places.


Ofcourse you can do it using excel as well. But we're not competing with excel. We're here to give you an easier way to check your finances. If you prefer to use excel, use that. But make sure your excel file is password protected and with you at all times. Because this application has fingerprint authentication and is installed on your phone on all times. So you just need to take out your phone and will be able to check your investments. 


Just to be clear, this application is not a portfolio tracker as well. There are plenty of applications that do that already. We're here to track money going out of your checking account into different type of investment. Consider it an easy way to check how much money you've invested over the years.

This application don't use internet connection, so be sure that data you insert in this application is not shared with anyone. It's just for you to see. So you can be sure that we can't track your investment data, nor can we sell anything to anyone.
